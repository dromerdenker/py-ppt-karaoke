# powerpoint Karaoke decker
Randomly creates an actual powerpoint deck by slapping together
5 random slides from the `assets` folder, adding
a Welcome page and a Thank you page.

# Why would you need this?
Ok, so the real fun is created by Vincent. He built a random
slide generator for powerpoint Karaoke. But the
issue what his machinery is that it generates
live slides, you cannot load those into powerpoint.

So Vincent generated a few hundred slides offline
for me, and I set out to generate actual decks.

All the credits for the assets go to Vincent.
You can book him for a fun game of Powerpoint Karaoke with your team.
